    + an extra life (like a shield)
    + a gun that continuously shoot and moves you forward
- gun levels
    + idk...

- problem 1: Shotgun is OP
    - Try adding health so shotgun bullets don't kill in one shot
    - Add power-ups
    - Make enemies smarter by making them move away from the shotgun range
- What if you had "puzzles" to solve during the play
- Spawn monsters close to you so you don't go look for them
- In room with closed doors, enemies should be initialized at half max time so that they don't immediately shoot
- Combos (2x, 3x...)
- New weapon that gets one more bullet each time you hit (gets better at each hit)
- If you're too close to the shooters, they should run away from you

Name ideas
- Super Line: Hot Miami
- Super Hot Line Miami
- SHLM!

Walker
- Maybe holding to move... Is an instinct

Nathan
- power ups
    + one that pauses time
    + an armor that protects you

- problem 1: it's too easy and boring to shoot then move backwards, shoot, move backwards
- problem 2: it's clearly optimal to shoot very fast
    + **IDEA** That could be fixed by keeping time running at real time (not slowed down) when swiping before the end of the time deceleration. So for the next shot, the moving time is the same but time goes by faster. Effectively enemies and bullets travel faster for those shots, which might make it hard enough to balance things out.
- problem 3: runners are utterly boring
- problem 4: levels might be slow to design. They're very quick to go through, so I'd need like 30 levels at least.
- I like the rooms + house idea of hotline miami. I kinda wanna copy that. But that means designing rooms, and the game is technically done after 1h of playing it. It might get more replayability with a bit of randomness in some areas. Actually the fact that it's not fully paused will add replayability, since enemies move in places that you wouldn't predict.
- **IDEA** What if you carrier a melee weapon on you as well as a gun, so when enemies are close, you melee them. This means that runners are more like shields, they prevent you from touching a target that's further and they auto-trigger the melee attack preventing from even shooting.
- **IDEA** Give enemy max shooting distance, so they don't shoot outside of the view (for most cases)
- Add furniture


Older stuff
- smarter enemies
    + make enemies that move enough that they're harder to hit (aim assist helps you less)
- aiming in a direction shifts the camera a bit, so that you can see more in that direction



- can we afford to put buttons on the screen? Where do we put "toggle weapons"?
- Spend more time on enemy AI
    + Cut-off behavior, something that'd get on the other side
- Add a grid map / maps
- new guns, more powerful guns will move time more and you in that direction
    + shotgun
    + one that shoots behind you
    + sniper
    + pistol
- different kinds of enemies
- count how many times you shot the guns and level up the guns based on that
    + They level up at the end of each level
- tilt your phone to rotate the map view (dude alwasy facing up)
