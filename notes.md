- put dead people in another list


October 25th
- power-ups
    + Pause time for a short period of time
    + 1 Armor
    + 1 Armor + Shoot bullets in all direction when touched
    + 1 Armor + Next person you shoot gets touched with a ray that spreads from on person to the next
    + 1 Armor + freeze everyone close to you
    + Those don't feel necessary
      + Continuously shooting gun?
      + Shooting backwards gun?
- Make enemies smarter
    + Add error to Melee
    + Add an enemy that dodges bullets
    + Cut-off behavior, something that'd get on the other side
- Add grenade launcher guy
- Fix pacing
    + [DONE] Spawn monsters close to you so you don't go look for them
    + [DONE] Spawn monsters in a wave pattern that is ever-increasing (let's see how far we can get with a simple sine that has a peak that grows)
    + Fix pacing more
- Fix map
    + Add furniture
    + Fix wall layout. You should spawn in the middle and each quadrant could be a style of gameplay (depending on which wave you're at)
- Make shield more of a line thing



October 24th
- gun levels -> doesn't feel needed

October 23rd    
- What if you had "puzzles" to solve during the play
- In room with closed doors, enemies should be initialized at half max time so that they don't immediately shoot
- Combos (2x, 3x...)
- New weapon that gets one more bullet each time you hit (gets better at each hit)

Name ideas
- Super Line: Hot Miami
- Super Hot Line Miami
- SHLM!

Walker
- Maybe holding to move... Is an instinct

October 19th
- problem 2: it's clearly optimal to shoot very fast
    + **IDEA** That could be fixed by keeping time running at real time (not slowed down) when swiping before the end of the time deceleration. So for the next shot, the moving time is the same but time goes by faster. Effectively enemies and bullets travel faster for those shots, which might make it hard enough to balance things out.
- problem 3: runners are utterly boring
- problem 4: levels might be slow to design. They're very quick to go through, so I'd need like 30 levels at least.
- I like the rooms + house idea of hotline miami. I kinda wanna copy that. But that means designing rooms, and the game is technically done after 1h of playing it. It might get more replayability with a bit of randomness in some areas. Actually the fact that it's not fully paused will add replayability, since enemies move in places that you wouldn't predict.
- **IDEA** What if you carrier a melee weapon on you as well as a gun, so when enemies are close, you melee them. This means that runners are more like shields, they prevent you from touching a target that's further and they auto-trigger the melee attack preventing from even shooting.
- **IDEA** Give enemy max shooting distance, so they don't shoot outside of the view (for most cases)


Older stuff
- new guns, more powerful guns will move time more and you in that direction
    + one that shoots behind you
    + sniper
- different kinds of enemies
- count how many times you shot the guns and level up the guns based on that
    + They level up at the end of each level
- tilt your phone left/right to rotate the map view (dude alwasy facing up)
