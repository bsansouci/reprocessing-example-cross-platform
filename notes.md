Important shit 
- smarter enemies
    + Path finding with corner cutting
    + make enemies that move enough that they're harder to hit (aim assist helps you less)
    + make enemies curve around corners
- Better collision (move until you actually hit the wall)
    + bullets shouldn't go through walls
- try zoom out a bit
- you need to die
- aiming in a direction shifts the camera a bit, so that you can see more in that direction



- can we afford to put buttons on the screen? Where do we put "toggle weapons"?
- Spend more time on enemy AI
    + Cut-off behavior, something that'd get on the other side
- Add a grid map / maps
- new guns, more powerful guns will move time more and you in that direction
    + shotgun
    + one that shoots behind you
    + sniper
    + pistol
- different kinds of enemies
- implements death
- [NO] watches you pick up give you "time", which runs out as you play
- count how many times you shot the guns and level up the guns based on that
    + They level up at the end of each level
- tilt your phone to rotate the map view (dude alwasy facing up)
